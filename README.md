# School_District_Analysis (File Name: Please open the following file for grading PyCITYSchools_Challenge_.ipynb)

## PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Chief Data Scientist for the PyCity School District has requested assistance with analyzing student standardized test scores and student funding for the PyCity High school District. Due to a recent discovery of potential alteration to the reading and math score for Thomas High School, the district has requested change to the "PyCitySchool" project we've previously created for the district. 

In the "PyCitySchools" project we leveraged python programming, utilizing the python library "panda' along with the Jupyter notebook to read raw data from the CVS file and transform the data into a format that can easily be utilized to create reports for school district officials. 

## PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this '"PyCitySchool Challenge" project is to documents the refracting process of the original code from "PyCitySchool". We will use the Pandas Numpy module to replace Thomas High School's reading and math score with NaN. 

## GOAL
After replacing Thomas high Schools' reading and math scores, a new analysis will be performed based on those changes. The changes will provide the school district with new insight to critical metrics for the PyCityScool District. 

#### DELIVERABLES 
1. Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
2. Repeat the school district analysis
3. School district analysis report

- Total Schools Count: 15
- Total Students : 39,170
- Total Budget: $24,649,428 

## RESULTS 
**Total Before replacing Thonas High School Scores**

- Average Math: 78.98 
- Average Reading: 81.87
- Percentage passing Math 74.8%
- Percentage Passing Reading: 85.7%
- -Overage Passing Percentage: 64.9

**Total Before replacing Thonas High School Scores**
- Average Math: 83.5
- Average Reading:83.9
- Percentage passing Math 93%
- Percentage Passing Reading: 97%
- -Overage Passing Percentage: 91%

## ANALYSIS 
Performance for the District overall passing percentage improved as a result of the changes made the Thomas Edison High School 9th grade scores.  

Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores significanlty impoved Thomas High School’s overall passing rate performance. As a result of the changes, Thomas High School's ranking went from bottom 5 performing schools to top 5 performing Schools. In addition to imporving Thomas High Schools performance rating, replacing the scores for Thomas High Schools increased the overall Math and reading scores by grade.

**Top 5 performing schools**

  - Cabera High School 
  - Thomas High School
  - Griffin High School 
  - Wilson High School 
  - Pena High School 
    
**Bottom 5 performing schools**

  - Redriguez High School 
  - Figueroa High School
  - Huang High School 
  - Johnson Hig School

 Below are the results for Scores by school spending, Scores by school size, Scores by school type. The below result were not significally impacted by the changes to the ninth grade scores at Thomas Edison.
