# School_District_Analysis

## PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Chief Data Scientist for the PyCity School District has requested assistance with analyzing student standardized test scores and student funding for the PyCity High school District. Due to a recent discovery of potential alteration to the reading and math score for Thomas High School, the district has requested change to the "PyCitySchool" project we've previously created for the district. 

In the "PyCitySchools" project we leveraged python programming, utilizing the python library "panda' along with the Jupyter notebook to read raw data from the CVS file and transform the data into a format that can easily be utilized to create reports for school district officials. 

## PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this '"PyCitySchool Challenge" project is to documents the refracting process of the original code from "PyCitySchool". We will use the Pandas Numpy module to replace Thomas High School's reading and math score with NaN. 

## GOAL
After replacing Thomas high Schools' reading and math scores, a new analysis will be performed based on those changes. The changes will provide the school district with new insight into the following metrics 

- District summary 
- School summary
- Top 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate 
- Bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate 
- Average math score for each grade level from each school 
- Average reading score for each grade level from each school 
- Scores by school spending per student 
- Scores by school size 
- Scores by school type 

## LOGICAL WORKFLOW

#### DELIVERABLES 
Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis
Deliverable 3: School district analysis report
